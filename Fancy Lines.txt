The lines can get real blurry real fast.

If you are not willing to look like a foolish beginner...you will never become a graceful master.

If you do not share it..it will eat you up.

While I was busy fighting others' battles, I forgot I had one of my own.

A painful truth is better than the hopeful confusion that keeps you stuck!

You only get what you want when you ask for it and stay ready.
